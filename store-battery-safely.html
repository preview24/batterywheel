        <h1>How to Store Your Battery Safely</h1>

        <p>
        Proper battery storage is one of the most overlooked aspects of battery care. 
        Whether you own an <strong>eBike</strong>, electric scooter, power bank, or solar backup system, 
        how you store your battery directly affects its lifespan and safety. 
        Improper storage can lead to capacity loss, overheating, or even permanent damage.  
        This guide explains <strong>how to store your battery safely</strong> for the best performance and longevity.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Choose a Cool, Dry Environment</h2>
        <p>
        Heat is a battery’s worst enemy. High temperatures accelerate chemical reactions inside lithium cells, 
        leading to faster aging and sometimes swelling or leakage.  
        At the same time, extremely cold environments can temporarily reduce capacity and voltage.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Best practice:</strong> Store your battery between <strong>15°C and 25°C (59°F–77°F)</strong> 
        in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area.  
        Avoid direct sunlight, heaters, or damp basements. If possible, store it in a shaded cabinet or on a shelf away from metal objects.</p>

        <h2>2. Keep Partial Charge — Not Full or Empty</h2>
        <p>
        Batteries should never be stored completely charged or completely drained.  
        A 100% charge for a long period increases internal stress, while a 0% charge can lead to deep discharge — 
        a condition that permanently damages lithium cells.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Best practice:</strong> Store your battery at around <strong>40–60% charge</strong>.  
        This level keeps the cells stable and prevents degradation.  
        If you plan long-term storage (over 3 months), check the battery every 60 days and recharge slightly if it drops below 30%.</p>

        <h2>3. Disconnect from Devices Before Storage</h2>
        <p>
        Many users forget to disconnect the battery from the eBike, inverter, or controller when not in use.  
        Even a small power drain from a connected device can discharge the battery slowly over time.  
        Always unplug or remove the battery pack entirely before storing it.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Use a Fire-Resistant Surface or Bag</h2>
        <p>
        Though rare, lithium batteries can experience thermal runaway if physically damaged or charged improperly.  
        For extra safety, place the battery on a non-flammable surface such as ceramic tile or concrete, 
        or use a <strong>Lipo safety bag</strong> designed to contain heat and flames in case of failure.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Avoid Humidity and Moisture</h2>
        <p>
        Moisture can corrode the terminals and damage the battery’s internal protection circuits.  
        Always store batteries in a dry environment. If you live in a humid area, 
        consider using silica gel packets or a dehumidifier near your storage location.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Label and Organize Batteries</h2>
        <p>
        If you maintain multiple battery packs, label each with its last charge date and storage voltage.  
        This helps you rotate them efficiently and ensure no pack sits unused for too long.  
        Proper organization also reduces the risk of short-circuiting or mixing incompatible batteries.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Inspect Before Reuse</h2>
        <p>
        After long storage, check your battery before reusing it.  
        Look for swelling, corrosion, or unusual smell.  
        If the battery shows any sign of physical damage or fails to hold charge, stop using it immediately and recycle it properly.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Safe Battery Storage Matters</h2>
        <p>
        Safe storage not only extends the battery’s life but also prevents costly replacements and safety hazards.  
        Lithium batteries are powerful energy sources — handling them correctly ensures reliability, 
        protects your property, and reduces the risk of fire or explosion.  
        Following these safety measures can easily <strong>add 6–12 months of life</strong> to your battery.
        </p>

        <h2>Quick Storage Checklist</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Store between 15°C–25°C (59°F–77°F)</li>
          <li>✅ Keep charge between 40%–60%</li>
          <li>✅ Disconnect from all devices</li>
          <li>✅ Use a fire-resistant surface or bag</li>
          <li>✅ Protect from moisture and humidity</li>
          <li>✅ Inspect before reuse</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
        Battery storage doesn’t require special equipment — only attention and good habits.  
        By maintaining the right temperature, charge level, and environment, 
        you’ll maximize your battery’s lifespan and keep it safe for years to come.
