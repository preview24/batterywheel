              <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction</h2>
              <p>When it comes to scooters, few names are as iconic and enduring as Vespa. Since its inception in 1946, this Italian brand has become synonymous with style, elegance, and urban mobility. Here, we’ll take a journey through the history and evolution of the Vespa scooter. Also we’ll explore what has made it a timeless classic cherished by riders all over the world.</p>
              <h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Birth of Vespa</h2>
              <p>The Vespa story began in the aftermath of World War II when Italy was rebuilding itself. The need for affordable and efficient transportation was growing. The Italian manufacturer <a href="https://www.piaggio.com/en_EN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Piaggio</a>, known for its aircraft and locomotive production, decided to enter the world of two-wheeled transport.</p>
              <p>The first Vespa model, the Vespa 98, rolled off the production line in 1946. It was designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corradino_D%27Ascanio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Corradino D’Ascanio</a>, an aeronautical engineer, and it featured a unique, streamlined design that set it apart from other scooters of the time. The name “Vespa,” which means “wasp” in Italian, was chosen due to the scooter’s slender, wasp-like appearance.</p>
